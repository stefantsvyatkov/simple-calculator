This program is elementary desktop calculator for Windows written with C# language and Microsoft's "Windows Forms" technology. It's optimized for work with the screen readers JAWS and NVDA, which are the most used programs from people with sight problems. There are buttons with associated key combinations For every kind of number operation. The supported operations are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition - Alt+A</li>
<li>Subtraction - Alt+S</li>
<li>Multiplication - Alt+M</li>
<li>Division - Alt+D</li>
<li>Calculating a percent value - Alt+P</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The program also can process number expressions, which will be discussed later in this document.

</p>
<p>
This initial setup is needed in first start or when the default settings of the program are reset.
</p>

<h2>6. Number operations</h2>

<p>
They can be made by using the corresponding buttons and/or entering of the operation signs in the number text box directly.
</p>

<a name="toc61"></a>
<h3>6.1. Calculating by the buttons</h3>

<p>
To make calculation, firstly enter a number and activate some of the buttons "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply", "Divide" or "Percent". This can be made by focusing the button and pressing Enter or the associated key combination. When some control (button or text box) is focused, the screen readers JAWS and NVDA report it's key shortcut.
</p>
<p>
After entering a number and choosing operation, the focus returns at the text box and second number must be entered. You can press another operation button and enter next number or activate the "Result" button.
</p>
<p><strong>
Example:
</p></strong>
<p>
To multiply 5 by 4,8, firstly enter 5, activate "Multiply" button, write 4,8 and press the "Result" button. It can be activated in 3 ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>move to it with the TAB key and press Space</li>
<li>Enter key somewhere in the program</li>
<li>the combination Alt+R</li>
</ul>
<p>
After activating this button, the result of the calculation will be shown in the text box. It also can be operated with other numbers infinitely.
</p>
<p><strong>
Example:
</p></strong>
<p>
From some calculation the result is 3,1. We can multiply it by 10, after that to subtract 2 and so on. In the end activate the "Result" button.
</p>

<a name="toc62"></a>
<h3>6.2. Calculating by entering the operation signs</h3>

<p>
The program allows entering the operation signs in the text box directly, without pressing of the corresponding buttons. It gives the possibility for calculating number expressions. The operation signs which can be used are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>+ - addition</li>
<li>- - subtraction</li>
<li>* - multiplication</li>
<li>/ - division</li>
<li>% - calculating a percent value</li>
</ul>
<p>
In order to make calculation in this way, enter expression as "3+7" and press enter. More complex expressions as "3+2+5-8*2/3.14" also can be calculated.
</p>

<a name="toc63"></a>
<h3>6.3. Calculating a percent value</h3>

<p>
It can be made by the following way:
</p>
<p>
Firstly enter the desired percent value, for example 20. Press the "Percent" button and write the number for which you want to calculate 20%, for example 200. If you press Enter, the result will be 40. The easier way is to write "20%200", press Enter and the result will be the above.
</p>

<h2>7. Context menu</h2>

<p>
The program has it's own context menu which can be activated by focusing some of the controls and pressing Applications key. It contains the following elements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Choose language" - shows window for choosing language. The confirmation can be made by activating "OK" button or pressing Enter.</li>
<li>"Reset default settings" - After activating this command, confirmation is required. If it's made, the calculator returns to the state before first start.</li>
<li>"Open the help file" - according to the application's language opens the present file in English or Bulgarian.</li>
<li>"Copy result automatically" - If it is checked, the result from every calculation is copied to the clipboard.</li>
<li>"Hide/Show operation buttons" - If the program is used mainly by entering the operation signs at the text box directly, the corresponding buttons can be hidden for easier use. When they are active the command is "Hide operation buttons", and in the reverse case it changes to "Show operation buttons".</li>
</ul>

<a name="toc71"></a>
<h3>7.1. Keyboard shortcuts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ctrl+L - "Choose language"</li>
<li>Ctrl+R - "Reset default settings"</li>
<li>Ctrl+H - "Open the help file"</li>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+C - "Copy result automatically"</li>
<li>Ctrl+B - "Hide/Show operation buttons"</li>
</ul>

<a name="toc8"></a>
<h2>8. Report calling of some functions</h2>

<p>
After activating the "Result" button, the calculated value is announced by the screen readers JAWS and NVDA automatically.
</p>
<p>
If number operations are made with the key combinations for the buttons, after pressing them, the screen reader reports the corresponding action.
</p>
<p><strong>
Examples:
</p></strong>
<p>
For Alt+A, "Add" is announced, for Alt+S - "Subtract" and so on.
</p>
<p>
With showing and hiding the operation buttons by the combination Ctrl+B, the screen reader reports this with the messages "Buttons are hidden", "Buttons are shown".
</p>
<p>
When the option "Copy result automatically" is changed by the combination Ctrl+Shift+C, it's reported by the messages "Auto copying on.", "Auto copying off.".
</p>

<h2>9. Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>When the program is used incorrectly, it shows error message which invites the user to make an operation or to enter a valid number.</li>
<li>The calculator is designed to accept only these symbols which are needed for it's work. For example, if you try to enter letter or other prohibited symbol, "beep" will be played and the symbol won't be entered. If you write invalid combination of digits and operators, activating of the "Result" button will cause showing of error message and the text will be deleted.</li>
<li>Pressing the "Clear" button returns the calculated number to it's default value, which is 0. This button can be activated with the Escape key.</li>
<li>The present version of this program is fully portable. It don't change files on your system and can be started even from flash stick without negative influence over the functionality.</li>
</ul>
